 RESULTS SUMMARY:
 >>> The model is structurally unidentifiable.
 >>> These parameters are identifiable:
      [b, c, d, w2, s]
 >>> These parameters are unidentifiable:
      [q1, q2, k1, k2, w1]
 >>> These states are unobservable (and their initial conditions, if unknown, are unidentifiable):
      [x2, x3]
 >>> These states are directly measured:
      [x1, x4]
 Total execution time: 1685.756371974945 seconds
