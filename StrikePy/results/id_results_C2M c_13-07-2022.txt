 RESULTS SUMMARY:
 >>> The model is structurally unidentifiable.
 >>> These parameters are identifiable:
      []
 >>> These parameters are unidentifiable:
      [x3, x4, x5, x6]
 >>> These states are unobservable (and their initial conditions, if unknown, are unidentifiable):
      [x2]
 >>> These states are directly measured:
      [x1]
 >>> These unmeasured inputs are unobservable:
