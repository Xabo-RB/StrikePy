 RESULTS SUMMARY:
 >>> The model is structurally unidentifiable.
 >>> These parameters are identifiable:
      [k4, k5, k6]
 >>> These parameters are unidentifiable:
      [k1, k2, k3, k7, s2, s3]
 >>> These states are observable (and their initial conditions, if unknown, are identifiable):
      [x1]
 >>> These states are unobservable (and their initial conditions, if unknown, are unidentifiable):
      [x2, x3, x4]
 >>> These inputs are known:
