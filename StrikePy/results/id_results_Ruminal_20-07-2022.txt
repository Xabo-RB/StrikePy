 RESULTS SUMMARY:
 >>> The model is structurally unidentifiable.
 >>> These parameters are identifiable:
      [k2, k3, k4]
 >>> These parameters are unidentifiable:
      [k1]
 >>> These states are observable (and their initial conditions, if unknown, are identifiable):
      [x2, x3, x5]
 >>> These states are directly measured:
      [x1, x4]
