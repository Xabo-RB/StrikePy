 RESULTS SUMMARY:
 >>> The model is structurally unidentifiable.
 >>> These parameters are identifiable:
      [nu, b0, M, mu, g]
 >>> These parameters are unidentifiable:
      [b1]
 >>> These states are observable (and their initial conditions, if unknown, are identifiable):
      [s]
 >>> These states are unobservable (and their initial conditions, if unknown, are unidentifiable):
      [x2, x1]
 >>> These states are directly measured:
      [i, r]
